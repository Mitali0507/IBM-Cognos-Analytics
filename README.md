# Data Preparation & Filtering
- Imported raw CSV files containing multi-response fields (e.g., programming languages, databases, platforms).
- Applied frequency-based filtering to extract the Top 10 records for each category—ensuring the visualizations focused on the most impactful trends.
- Used calculated fields and grouping logic to handle overlapping entries and derive clean, interpretable insights.
# Dashboard Design Highlights
- Created bar charts, pie charts, treemaps, bubble charts, and stacked bar charts to represent:
  - Top 10 programming languages, databases, platforms, and web frameworks.
  - Age and education distribution across respondents.
  - Geographic spread via a shaded world map.
- Prioritized clarity and accessibility, experimenting with color palettes, label placement, and chart types to suit each data story.
- Despite some drag-and-drop limitations, creatively restructured data to enable cross-dimensional analysis (e.g., age vs education level).
# Key Learnings
- Learned to work around Cognos constraints by restructuring data manually and using calculated fields.
- Understood the importance of filtering and aggregation in storytelling—Top 10 lists helped focus attention on dominant trends.
- Gained hands-on experience in designing audience-ready dashboards that balance technical depth with visual clarity.
